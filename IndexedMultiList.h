valid indices range from 0 up to unique size (inclusive).  So for an empty list, 0 is the only valid index.  
insert should do nothing if index is invalid
If the list has 3 A’s in the first position, then 0 and 1 are the only valid indices.

returns true iff index was valid
change should do nothing if index is invalid
amount could be negative, if adding amount to the current count results in a count of <= 0 then position should be removed
For example, if there are 3 A’s at index 0 and 2 B’s at index 1 in the list iml then
iml.change(0, -4) 
would remove all the A’s and the 2 B’s would be at index 0.

//then only remove from the first location
